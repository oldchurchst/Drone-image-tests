You are a python expert. I would like to build an application in python that analysis's a series of images that were captured by a DJI drone and use those images to find the flightpath of the drone by comparing the images with google maps or other online aerial image sources. 
The application should use AI to achieve this. 
Do not use the meta data of the images. Use only the image data.
Give an option to identify the location of the first image. This will help narrow down where in the world the drone is and should help simplify the problem. 
There is an open source project called OpenCV that may be helpful.
